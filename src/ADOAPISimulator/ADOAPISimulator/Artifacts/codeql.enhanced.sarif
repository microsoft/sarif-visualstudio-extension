In most cases this is not useful, or what was intended.

                  "text": "# Chain of 'is' tests\nLong sequences of type tests are primarily used to dispatch to different bits of code based on the type of a variable, as shown in the example later in this topic. They are often used to simulate pattern-matching in languages that do not support it. Whilst they do work as a dispatch method, they have a number of disadvantages:\n\n* They are difficult to maintain, because it is easy to add a new subtype and forget to modify all of the type test sequences throughout your code.\n* They introduce unwanted dependencies on concrete classes. Code that could be written only in terms of an interface must now take account of all the special cases.\n* They can be error-prone - if you inadvertently test for a base type before a derived type, the code that handles the derived type is never executed.\n* They can exhibit poor performance, because they effectively iterate through a list of types in linear time, checking each one in turn.\n\n## Recommendation\nThere are a number of possible solutions to the problem, depending on the exact circumstances:\n\n* **Polymorphism**. This involves adding a virtual method to the type hierarchy and putting the bits of code to be called in the relevant override for each concrete class. It is a tidy solution when you can change the type hierarchy in question and the operation being implemented is a core part of the functionality that the types in question should implement. It is important to be careful not to introduce unwanted dependencies if you choose this approach - if the operation depends on things that themselves depend on the type hierarchy, then you cannot move the operation to the type hierarchy without creating a dependency cycle.\n* **The visitor pattern**. This involves introducing a visitor interface containing a `visit` method for each type in the type hierarchy, and adding an `accept` method to each type in the hierarchy that takes such a visitor as its parameter. Each type's `accept` method calls the visitor's `visit` method on `this`. Concrete visitors then implement the interface and do whatever is necessary for each specific type. This is a good solution when you can change the type hierarchy in question and the type hierarchy should not know about the operation being implemented, either for dependency reasons or because it is not part of the core functionality of the types in the hierarchy. It is also sensible if you want to provide multiple operations with the same structure on the same set of types and you want the types themselves to control the way in which the operation is structured (for example 'visit this tree using an in-order walk and do whatever is necessary for each node'). The disadvantages are that the basic visitor pattern is cyclically-dependent, and that the infrastructure involved is comparatively heavyweight.\n* **Reflection**. This involves looking up one of a set of overloaded methods based on the type of one of the method parameters, and calling it manually. This option should never be the first choice because it necessitates a loss of type safety and is rather untidy, but there are times when it can be sensible. In particular, it is useful when you cannot change the type hierarchy in question (for example because it is third-party code) and your code must compile with versions of C\\# that do not support `dynamic` (pre-4.0).\n* **Use `dynamic`**. This involves converting (either explicitly or implicitly) the type of the object to `dynamic` so as to perform a dynamically-resolved call on it. It is only an option in C\\# 4.0 and later. As with reflection, it necessitates a loss of type safety, although it is somewhat cleaner from a syntactic perspective.

                  "markdown": "# Chain of 'is' tests\nLong sequences of type tests are primarily used to dispatch to different bits of code based on the type of a variable, as shown in the example later in this topic. They are often used to simulate pattern-matching in languages that do not support it. Whilst they do work as a dispatch method, they have a number of disadvantages:\n\n* They are difficult to maintain, because it is easy to add a new subtype and forget to modify all of the type test sequences throughout your code.\n* They introduce unwanted dependencies on concrete classes. Code that could be written only in terms of an interface must now take account of all the special cases.\n* They can be error-prone - if you inadvertently test for a base type before a derived type, the code that handles the derived type is never executed.\n* They can exhibit poor performance, because they effectively iterate through a list of types in linear time, checking each one in turn.\n\n## Recommendation\nThere are a number of possible solutions to the problem, depending on the exact circumstances:\n\n* **Polymorphism**. This involves adding a virtual method to the type hierarchy and putting the bits of code to be called in the relevant override for each concrete class. It is a tidy solution when you can change the type hierarchy in question and the operation being implemented is a core part of the functionality that the types in question should implement. It is important to be careful not to introduce unwanted dependencies if you choose this approach - if the operation depends on things that themselves depend on the type hierarchy, then you cannot move the operation to the type hierarchy without creating a dependency cycle.\n* **The visitor pattern**. This involves introducing a visitor interface containing a `visit` method for each type in the type hierarchy, and adding an `accept` method to each type in the hierarchy that takes such a visitor as its parameter. Each type's `accept` method calls the visitor's `visit` method on `this`. Concrete visitors then implement the interface and do whatever is necessary for each specific type. This is a good solution when you can change the type hierarchy in question and the type hierarchy should not know about the operation being implemented, either for dependency reasons or because it is not part of the core functionality of the types in the hierarchy. It is also sensible if you want to provide multiple operations with the same structure on the same set of types and you want the types themselves to control the way in which the operation is structured (for example 'visit this tree using an in-order walk and do whatever is necessary for each node'). The disadvantages are that the basic visitor pattern is cyclically-dependent, and that the infrastructure involved is comparatively heavyweight.\n* **Reflection**. This involves looking up one of a set of overloaded methods based on the type of one of the method parameters, and calling it manually. This option should never be the first choice because it necessitates a loss of type safety and is rather untidy, but there are times when it can be sensible. In particular, it is useful when you cannot change the type hierarchy in question (for example because it is third-party code) and your code must compile with versions of C\\# that do not support `dynamic` (pre-4.0).\n* **Use `dynamic`**. This involves converting (either explicitly or implicitly) the type of the object to `dynamic` so as to perform a dynamically-resolved call on it. It is only an option in C\\# 4.0 and later. As with reflection, it necessitates a loss of type safety, although it is somewhat cleaner from a syntactic perspective. It is a useful approach when you cannot change the type hierarchy in question or you are keen to avoid a heavyweight solution like the visitor pattern (you are effectively losing some type safety to gain some readability).\n\n## Example\nThis example uses a series of chained `is` statements to perform a different action depending on what kind of `Animal` is being iterated over.\n\n\n```csharp\nclass ChainedIs\n{\n    interface Animal { }\n    class Cat : Animal { }\n    class Dog : Animal { }\n\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        List<Animal> animals = new List<Animal> { new Cat(), new Dog() };\n        foreach (Animal a in animals)\n        {\n            if (a is Cat)\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Miaow!\");\n            else if (a is Dog)\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Woof!\");\n            else\n                throw new Exception(\"Oops!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\nPolymorphism is illustrated in the example below.\n\n\n```csharp\nclass ChainedIs\n{\n    interface Animal\n    {\n        void Speak();\n    }\n    class Cat : Animal\n    {\n        public void Speak() { Console.WriteLine(\"Miaow!\"); }\n    }\n    class Dog : Animal\n    {\n        public void Speak() { Console.WriteLine(\"Woof!\"); }\n    }\n\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        List<Animal> animals = new List<Animal> { new Cat(), new Dog() };\n        foreach (var a in animals)\n            a.Speak();\n    }\n}\n\n```\nHere is the same example again using the visitor pattern.

This is because the `GasolineCar` class is inheriting `Equals(object)` from `Car` and that method states that two `Car`s are equal if their make and model are the same.\n\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Bad\n{\n    class Car\n    {\n        protected string make;\n        protected string model;\n\n        public Car(string make, string model)\n        {\n            this.make = make;\n            this.model = model;\n        }\n\n        public override bool Equals(object obj)\n        {\n            if (obj is Car c && c.GetType() == typeof(Car))\n                return make == c.make && model == c.model;\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    class GasolineCar : Car\n    {\n        protected bool unleaded;\n\n        public GasolineCar(string make, string model, bool unleaded) : base(make, model)\n        {\n            this.unleaded = unleaded;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        var car1 = new GasolineCar(\"Ford\", \"Focus\", true);\n        var car2 = new GasolineCar(\"Ford\", \"Focus\", false);\n        Console.WriteLine(\"car1 \" + (car1.Equals(car2) ? \"does\" : \"does not\") + \" equal car2.\");\n    }\n}\n\n```\nIn the revised example, `GasolineCar` overrides `Equals(object)`, and the output is \"car1 does not equal car2\", as expected.\n\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Good\n{\n    class Car\n    {\n        protected string make;\n        protected string model;\n\n        public Car(string make, string model)\n        {\n            this.make = make;\n            this.model = model;\n        }\n\n        public override bool Equals(object obj)\n        {\n            if (obj is Car c && c.GetType() == typeof(Car))\n                return make == c.make && model == c.model;\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    class GasolineCar : Car\n    {\n        protected bool unleaded;\n\n        public GasolineCar(string make, string model, bool unleaded) : base(make, model)\n        {\n            this.unleaded = unleaded;\n        }\n\n        public override bool Equals(object obj)\n        {\n            if (obj is GasolineCar gc && gc.GetType() == typeof(GasolineCar))\n                return make == gc.make && model == gc.model && unleaded == gc.unleaded;\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        var car1 = new GasolineCar(\"Ford\", \"Focus\", true);\n        var car2 = new GasolineCar(\"Ford\", \"Focus\", false);\n        Console.WriteLine(\"car1 \" + (car1.Equals(car2) ? \"does\" : \"does not\") + \" equal car2.\");\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Microsoft: [Equality Operators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/equality-operators), [Equality Comparisons (C\\# Programming Guide)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/equality-comparisons).\n"

One of the best ways is to use an immutable object to store fields. References to this object can be passed outside the class but the objects are immutable so they cannot be changed.\n\nAnother good way of preventing external modification of private fields is to only ever return a copy of the object referred to by the field.

For example, the source code may be open source, or it may be leaked or accidentally revealed. For applications shipped as binaries, the credentials may be accessible within the compiled assemblies.\n\nFor inbound authentication, hard-coded credentials may allow unauthorized access to the system. This is particularly problematic if the credential is hard-coded in the source code, because it cannot be disabled easily. For outbound authentication, the hard-coded credentials may provide an attacker with privileged information or unauthorized access to some other system.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nRemove hard-coded credentials, such as user names, passwords and certificates, from source code, placing them in configuration files or other data stores if necessary. If possible, store configuration files including credential data separately from the source code, in a secure location with restricted access.\n\nFor outbound authentication details, consider encrypting the credentials or the enclosing data stores or configuration files, and using permissions to restrict access.\n\nFor inbound authentication details, consider hashing passwords using standard library functions where possible. For example, Microsoft provide the class `Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.PasswordHasher`.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following examples shows different types of inbound and outbound authentication.\n\nIn the first case, we accept a password from a remote user, and compare it against a plaintext string literal. If an attacker acquires the source code, or the assemblies, they can observe the password, and can log in to the system.

This circumvents the need to specify an index at all, and therefore prevents errors where the index is out of bounds.\n\n\n```csharp\nusing System.IO;\nusing System;\n\nclass ContainerLengthOffByOne\n{\n    public static boolean BadContains(string searchName, string names)\n    {\n        string[] values = names.Split(',');\n        // BAD: index could be equal to length\n        for (int i = 0; i <= values.Length; i++)\n        {\n            // When i = length, this access will be out of bounds\n            if (values[i] == searchName)\n            {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static boolean GoodContains(string searchName, string names)\n    {\n        string[] values = names.Split(',');\n        // GOOD: Avoid using indexes, and use foreach instead\n        foreach (string name in values)\n        {\n            if (name == searchName)\n            {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-193](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/193.html).\n"

Although an `IEnumerable` will often be backed by a `List`, or some other collection that can be iterated over multiple times, it is not guaranteed that the referred-to sequence will always be repeatable - if we iterate over an `IEnumerable` multiple times, it is perfectly possible that we will get different results each time.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIf you need to iterate over a sequence multiple times, you must make sure that it is repeatable, and you should change the type of the sequence to make sure that this constraint is enforced. A common way to do this (although it is not applicable in every situation) is to call LINQ's ` ToList` method on your sequence at the time you create it and then assign it to an `IList ` with the appropriate element type. Since it is safe to iterate over a list multiple times, this solves the problem. However, you must be careful when doing this - in the case of something like `File.ReadLines`, the sequence returned is deliberately lazy (there may not be enough heap space to keep the entire file in memory at once), so calling `ToList` would create other problems. In that situation, you may need to redesign the way your code works to keep the lazy behavior whilst avoiding multiple iteration.\n\nAs a concrete example of this, consider the situation where you need to check whether or not a lazy sequence contains any elements before zipping it with another sequence - in such a situation, an appropriate technique would be to write a wrapper that tries to consume an element of the sequence (to check whether or not it is empty), and then either returns a sequence that yields the consumed element followed by the rest of the sequence or returns null. By checking the result against null, it is then possible to test whether or not the original sequence was empty; if it was not empty, the new sequence can be used to yield all of the elements of the original sequence as desired.\n\n\n## Example\nFor example, the method `NonRepeatable` in the example below yields a non-repeatable sequence of three integers. The second loop over `nr` does nothing, because the non-repeatable sequence has already been consumed. Although this example is somewhat contrived, non-repeatable sequences are unfortunately not all that rare - in particular, C\\# library methods such as `File.ReadLines` return such sequences.

In particular, this makes the code easier to read by expressing the intent better and by reducing the nesting depth of the code.\n\n\n## Example\nThis example shows two ways of iterating over a series of integers and only performing an action on the even ones.\n\n\n```csharp\nclass MissedWhereOpportunity\n{\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        List<int> lst = Enumerable.Range(1, 10).ToList();\n\n        foreach (int i in lst)\n        {\n            if (i % 2 != 0)\n                continue;\n            Console.WriteLine(i);\n            Console.WriteLine((i / 2));\n        }\n\n        foreach (int i in lst)\n        {\n            if (i % 2 == 0)\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(i);\n                Console.WriteLine((i / 2));\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\nThis is far better expressed using the `Where` method.\n\n\n```csharp\nclass MissedWhereOpportunityFix\n{\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        List<int> lst = Enumerable.Range(1, 10).ToList();\n\n        foreach (int i in lst.Where(e => e % 2 == 0))\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(i);\n            Console.WriteLine((i / 2));\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* MSDN: [Enumerable.Where Method](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.linq.enumerable.where.aspx).\n"

This can be caused by nesting the call to `System.Threading.Monitor.Wait()` in two `lock` statements, or by waiting on a different object to the one which is locked.\n\nSynchronized methods (with the attribute `[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.Synchronized)]`) can also cause problems, because they are equivalent to `lock(this)` or `lock(typeof(Class))`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that the call to `System.Threading.Monitor.Wait()` occurs within a single `lock` statement and ensure that the argument to `System.Threading.Monitor.Wait()` matches the variable in the `lock` statement.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example locks two variables, `countLock` and `textLock`, then calls `System.Threading.Monitor.Wait()`.

This file would then be sent back to the user, giving them access to all the system's passwords.\n\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Web;\n\npublic class TaintedPathHandler : IHttpHandler\n{\n    public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext ctx)\n    {\n        String path = ctx.Request.QueryString[\"path\"];\n        // BAD: This could read any file on the filesystem.\n        ctx.Response.Write(File.ReadAllText(path));\n\n        // BAD: This could still read any file on the filesystem.\n        ctx.Response.Write(File.ReadAllText(\"/home/user/\" + path));\n\n        // GOOD: MapPath ensures the path is safe to read from.\n        string safePath = ctx.Request.MapPath(path, ctx.Request.ApplicationPath, false);\n        ctx.Response.Write(File.ReadAllText(safePath));\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-36](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/36.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-73](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/73.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-99](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/99.html).\n"

A prepared statement can include a parameter, written as either a question mark (`?`) or with an explicit name (`@parameter`), for each part of the SQL query that is expected to be filled in by a different value each time it is run.

It is therefore bad practice to modify this state from any particular instance. Because static fields are shared between all instances of a class existing in all threads of a program, one instance trying to read the field while another tries to write it can lead to race conditions and hence mean the class is not thread safe. It also decreases readability as most developers expect instance methods to only affect the instance state and static methods to only affect the static state.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIt is important to evaluate the situation carefully before implementing a fix for an alert of this rule. Perhaps the field is erroneously declared static, and should in fact be an instance field; if so, then remove the static modifier from the field. If the field genuinely has to be static, evaluate the assumptions behind the code. Does it really have to be modified directly in an instance method? It could be helpful to wrap the accesses to the field in static methods, so that any concerns about synchronization can be addressed while avoiding code duplication.\n\n\n## Example\nIn this example the field called \"name\" has been mistakenly declared static. Attempting to rename a person will actually modify the static name field and affect all people.\n\n\n```csharp\npublic class Customer\n{\n    private static String name;\n    public void rename(String newname)\n    {\n        name = newname; // BAD\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* MSDN, C\\# Reference, [static](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/98f28cdx(v=vs.71).aspx).\n",

Because static fields are shared between all instances of a class existing in all threads of a program, one instance trying to read the field while another tries to write it can lead to race conditions and hence mean the class is not thread safe. It also decreases readability as most developers expect instance methods to only affect the instance state and static methods to only affect the static state.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIt is important to evaluate the situation carefully before implementing a fix for an alert of this rule. Perhaps the field is erroneously declared static, and should in fact be an instance field; if so, then remove the static modifier from the field. If the field genuinely has to be static, evaluate the assumptions behind the code. Does it really have to be modified directly in an instance method? It could be helpful to wrap the accesses to the field in static methods, so that any concerns about synchronization can be addressed while avoiding code duplication.\n\n\n## Example\nIn this example the field called \"name\" has been mistakenly declared static. Attempting to rename a person will actually modify the static name field and affect all people.\n\n\n```csharp\npublic class Customer\n{\n    private static String name;\n    public void rename(String newname)\n    {\n        name = newname; // BAD\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* MSDN, C\\# Reference, [static](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/98f28cdx(v=vs.71).aspx).\n"

This is particularly important in performance-critical code.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nCreate the `StringBuilder` before the loop, and call the `Clear` method within the loop to clear the internal buffer.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example creates a new `StringBuilder` in the body of the loop.\n\n\n```csharp\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\n    foreach (var arg in args)\n    {\n        var sb = new StringBuilder();  // BAD: Creation in loop\n        sb.Append(\"Hello \").Append(arg);\n        Console.WriteLine(sb);\n    }\n}\n\n```\nThe code has been rewritten so that the same `StringBuilder` is used for every iteration of the loop.\n\n\n```csharp\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\n    var sb = new StringBuilder();  // GOOD: Creation outside loop\n    foreach (var arg in args)\n    {\n        sb.Clear();\n        sb.Append(\"Hello \").Append(arg);\n        Console.WriteLine(sb);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* MSDN: [StringBuilder](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.stringbuilder.aspx).\n"

So, in our example, replace `new StringBuilder('(')` with `new StringBuilder(\"(\")`. If the character is not a literal value, use `ToString()` to convert it to a string, or use an additional call to `Append()` to insert the value into the string.\n\n\n## References\n* MSDN: [StringBuilder Class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.stringbuilder.aspx)\n",

This is very bad practice.\n\n\n```csharp\nclass DubiousTypeTestOfThis\n{\n    class BaseClass\n    {\n        public int add(int x)\n        {\n            if (this is FiveAdder)\n                return x + 5;\n\n            if (this is TenAdder)\n                return x + 10;\n\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    class FiveAdder : BaseClass\n    {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    class TenAdder : BaseClass\n    {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\n```\n"

This code is efficient but will not work properly if the property is accessed from multiple threads, because `LoadNameFromDatabase` could be called several times.\n\n\n```csharp\nstring name;\n\npublic string Name\n{\n    get\n    {\n        // BAD: Not thread-safe\n        if (name == null)\n            name = LoadNameFromDatabase();\n        return name;\n    }\n}\n\n```\nA common solution to this is *double-checked locking*, which checks whether the stored value is `null` before locking the mutex.

This means that `count` is not synchronized with `GenerateDiagnostics()`, and there is a read barrier missing from the property getter, which could cause bugs on some CPU architectures.\n\n\n```csharp\npublic int ErrorCount\n{\n    get\n    {\n        return count;\n    }\n\n    set\n    {\n        lock (mutex)\n        {\n            count = value;\n            if (count > 0) GenerateDiagnostics();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\nThe solution is to add a `lock` statement to the property getter, as follows:\n\n\n```csharp\npublic int ErrorCount\n{\n    get\n    {\n        lock (mutex)\n        {\n            return count;\n        }\n    }\n\n    set\n    {\n        lock (mutex)\n        {\n            count = value;\n            if (count > 0) GenerateDiagnostics();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* MSDN, C\\# Reference: [lock Statement](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/c5kehkcz.aspx).\n* Wikipedia: [Memory barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_barrier).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-662](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/662.html).\n"

Several of the built-in types have this behavior, including `int`, `uint`, `short`, `ushort`, `long`, `ulong`, `byte` and `sbyte`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nRemove the call to `GetHashCode()`, and review the hash function.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following hash function has two problems. Firstly, the calls to `GetHashCode()` are redundant, and secondly, the hash function generates too many collisions.\n\n\n```csharp\npublic override int GetHashCode()\n{\n    return row.GetHashCode() ^ col.GetHashCode();\n}\n\n```\nThese problems are resolved by removing the redundant calls to `GetHashCode()`, and by changing the hash function to generate fewer collisions.\n\n\n```csharp\npublic override int GetHashCode()\n{\n    return unchecked(row * 16777619 + col);\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* MSDN, C\\# Reference, [Object.GetHashCode Method](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object.gethashcode.aspx).\n"

The first is to escape user input before passing it to the `WriteRaw` API, which prevents a malicious user from closing or opening XML tags.

These entries include a file path for the entry, but these file paths are not restricted and may contain unexpected special elements such as the directory traversal element (`..`). If these file paths are used to determine an output file to write the contents of the archive item to, then the file may be written to an unexpected location. This can result in sensitive information being revealed or deleted, or an attacker being able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected files.\n\nFor example, if a zip file contains a file entry `..\\sneaky-file`, and the zip file is extracted to the directory `c:\\output`, then naively combining the paths would result in an output file path of `c:\\output\\..\\sneaky-file`, which would cause the file to be written to `c:\\sneaky-file`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that output paths constructed from zip archive entries are validated to prevent writing files to unexpected locations.\n\nThe recommended way of writing an output file from a zip archive entry is to:\n\n1.

Firstly, we need to resolve any directory traversal or other special characters in the path by using `Path.GetFullPath`.
