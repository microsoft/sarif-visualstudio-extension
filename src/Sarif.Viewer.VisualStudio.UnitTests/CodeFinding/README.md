This is a suite of tests we have for the Codefinder algorithms that we use to match our insights to their respective lines in the IDE, handling code drift as much as possible.

In TestFiles there are a set of example C, C++, and C# files that we have, and we try to match insights to them.

Currently FunctionsPodServiceHelper.cs, ControlServer.cs, and ScaleVmss.cs are from the [AAPT Antares Website respository](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_git/AAPT-Antares-Websites)

The other files are example files that we made specifically for testing functionality.
